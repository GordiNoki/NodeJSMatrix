# NodeJSMatrix
Basic, simple, classic.

I just wanted to show matrix in terminal, but I couldn't find any good solutions with it. So I made my own.

To launch it download this file to any folder in your pc, open terminal and write:
```
node matrix.js
```
You can get the best performance if you'll open this in basic windows command prompt. Both powershell and Windows Terminal shown some laggy expreience.
